Jimmy was the name my mom gave me. When I was younger I thought I was going to become a superhero, but the older I got, the more unrealistic that dream got. My dream now is to one day become a fullstack developer and work with **MongoDB, ExpressJS, React and NodeJS**. I love exercising whether it's playing hockey with some friends or lift some heavy weights at the gym. I am currently studying Software Development and Operations at the Linneaus University in Kalmar, Sweden.
