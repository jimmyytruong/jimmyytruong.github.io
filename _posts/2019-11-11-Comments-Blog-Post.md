I used disqus for my blog posts. Go to https://www.disqus.com/. 

First, you have to register. Then follow their super simple guide. To be honest, this one was quite tricky in the beginning since I tried to implement disqus to my website when I didn't have an ethernet connection. I implemented the code for my website, but it didn't seem to load. Silly me!
