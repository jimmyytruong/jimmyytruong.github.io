There are pros and cons to almost everything and Static site generators are no exception. Static Site Generators provides compiled file to the browser that cuts the loading time by a large scale. Since there are no backend, the site can be hosted on a CDN (Content Delievery Network). There are also no database, so less cost and less maintenance. Also, free hosting on Github is a big thumbs up!

A static site generator can't have all the features that **dynammic sites** could have.
