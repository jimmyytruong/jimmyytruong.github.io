# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

CSS preprocessors like SASS takes the written code and converts it to “normal CSS”. The preprocessed language offers more functionality like variables, nesting and other techniques. Pre-compiled CSS is a time-saver. 

# Compare to regular CSS

Pre-compiled CSS offer developers extended techniques compared to normal CSS. A difference between pre-compiled CSS and normal CSS is that the pre-compiler makes you aware if you make a typo and missing components within the code. Regular CSS on the other hand is a lot more simple and basic when it comes to formatting and designing your web page. When you're used to something, that something is usually much easier to use.

# Which techniques did you use?


# Pros and cons?

There are probably more pros than cons when it comes to Pre-compiled CSS. One of many pros is that you can reuse your code. Since we're following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, Pre-compiled CSS is an excellent choice. A huge con to this is debugging since generated code is not the same as within source code.
